<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>A world starts to take its shape, dancing through fog. The same wobbly haze that paints oases onto the desert.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AL" visible={false}>The new light stings my opened eyes. My head hurts.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AE" visible={false}>From the aqueous void, a sudden gravity starts to assert itself, and buoys up the dim image of a room, birthing solid surfaces and the texture of deliberate shapes. around me.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>The walls pick up their skirts, leaning on one other for support. I feel a pillow crawl out of my ear and a swaddling blanket wrap itself around my legs. A rug comes to comfort the petrified floor beneath me. The windows on one side are glowing like hot coals, and the curtains can't contain their excitement.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>A mind begins to make itself up, starts to summon words in order to form coherent sense of what it sees …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
 <Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>What was that? ... The tick of the second hand, punctuating silence. </Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>I was wearing a watch, apparently.</Passage>
<Passage id="JK" visible={false}>Watch, ticking. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>Let me feel, now. …</Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>I had hands, hands for touching. I counted the fingers, tapping them down on their palms at arm's length above me …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>I reached down. I had feet … Thighs and …  Unmentionables. A belly-button too, a chest, neck – and, ah, a face. Regular breathing and a steady pulse …</Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>Tongue caressed tooth. I brought my hand up to feel my lips, and the hole of my mouth.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I felt the back of my skull. No exit wound that I could find … Perhaps I had brain damage of some sort. I couldn't tell …</Passage>
 <Passage id="AB" visible={false}>But I was alive, apparently.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Now … Where was I? Every-thing is some-where, natch …</Passage>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>Damn straight, I was lying on some unfamiliar floor, flat on my back and completely naked.</Passage>
<Passage id="FK" visible={false}>Lying on some unfamiliar floor. Flat on my back. Nude.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>What had coalesced around me seemed to be the distraught remains of an antique drawing-room. What once might have been elegant was now in pieces, every item of décor out of its proper place, willy-nilly, topsy-turvy.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Where I was lying, the accumulated pillows, cushions, towels and bedding of at least a half-dozen sofas and beds had been pooled to create a make-shift nest. Several books lay at my feet, taken from the empty shelves around the room and scattered seemingly at random, near and far. Every piece of furniture was over-turned, every drawer, every cupboard ransacked and left ravished. Besides the several pieces of wood and wicker which lay about the room like jettisoned ballast, the entire floor was an array of ash-trays and trash strewn haphazardly across the weathered rug. Dozens of empty bottles lay round about where I lay, drained of poison, along with several packs' worth of playing cards strewn in amongst all this other mayhem – abandoned board games with all their pieces missing, an old gramophone with its horn crammed full of news-papers, stuffed roughly. Lamps, an ancient globe, egg-shell empty, cracked and shattered. Another upturned hemi-sphere made of glass which I initially took for a space-helmet, but on closer inspection turned out to be a gold-fish bowl. From my own low angle I could spy a spent fire-extinguisher stashed beneath the chest of drawers. There was also an arm-chair whose arms were plastered with duct-tape bandages. It was missing one leg but still stood upright, propped up at one corner by a stack of mouldy almanacs. I thought I saw a cutlass hilt jutting from the seat, the stuffing mingled on the rug with the guts of a teddy-bear trapped under one of its other feet, horribly disembowelled, eyes popping out of its little face in horror. Every other chair in the room was tipped on its back or angled in some hysterical posture against the wall. I counted nine in all – but only counting the various legs and fragments which could be added up and reconstructed to form some vague totality. A crippled grand-father clock in the corner was the sorriest sight of all, utterly ruined by some desperate act of sabotage. Its pendulum had been yanked loose and was nowhere to be seen, both hands missing and its face wearing a sorry look. Just at my feet there was a bowlful of cigarette butts languishing in a rotten sludge mixed from ash and some foul solvent. Most of the smokes that I could see were red-smirched by lip-stick on their draw-end, but there were no tubes to speak of ... A mantle-piece on the opposite wall was lined with empty photo-frames, a stricken darts-board studded with cutlery and a little brass crocodile with its serrated mouth agape lined beneath a huge, cracked ornamental mirror hanging on the wall above. The dark stains across every horizontal surface that suggested some desperate fight to the death involving lots of hot coffee had occurred here in the immediate past. Scorch-marks and splatters, all bathing in a peculiar glow emanating from the lacy curtains clenched tight in defiance of the rising light out-side. The only aperture was a single doorway in the far wall, the door itself ripped from its hinges and resting at a diagonal slant against its frame.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>I rolled onto my belly, trying to align my body with a mental state pitched in some dread inversion – but I suddenly felt a sharp pain in the ribs, and upon investigation my hand came up clutching a pen that had been embedded in between my body and the sheets. </Passage>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>I tossed it away and, turning onto my back once again, I brought the watch up to my eye to clock the hour.</Passage>
<Passage id="FK" visible={false}>A pen, of some description. I tucked it in my pocket for later, and brought the watch up to my eye to clock the hour.</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="AH" visible={false}>Ten-ten. So it said.</Passage>

</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>But then – I saw something …</Passage>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>I took my fingers to pinch at the side of the dial, unwinding a thin clutch of hair, a long skein caught in the strap …</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>It un-ravelled like a plot, a shimmer-crack in space like gossamer floss ... It tremored like a harp-string, hanging in the close air before my very eyes.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>Not minding my nakedness, I heaved my-self to my feet.</Passage>
 <Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>And then I saw him.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>Lying on his back next to me was a man. Flat as a slab of ice.</Passage>
<Passage id="FL" visible={false}>On his back next to me, a man. Flat as a slab of ice.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I dared not touch him but just stood by him, looking down. He was dressed in a t-shirt and jeans, with bare feet and a bald head. It looked freshly shaved, even down to the eyebrows. His hands were at his sides, eyes closed, his clothing un-disturbed. </Passage>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>He might've just now fallen asleep. </Passage>
<Passage id="FK" visible={false}>Then again, perhaps he had been lying there for days.</Passage>
<Passage id="FK" visible={false}>Then again, perhaps so had I. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>On his neck, on a knotted string, was a brass key.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="JK" visible={false}>On his neck, on a knotted string, is a brass key.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="BJ" visible={false}>I leant down and snatched the key from his neck, quickly, as if he might stir.</Passage>
<Passage id="BJ" adds={["CC", "CD", "CE", "CF", "CG", "CH", "CI", "CJ", "CK"]} subtracts={["AC", "BC" ]} visible={false}>He didn't, natch. He was dead.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>What fresher clues? </Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Cautiously, I knelt and held a hand to the gulf between nose and mouth. After a while, I withdrew it again.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Nothing. Stone dead.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>I did not recognise his face, nor any other part. An utter stranger.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>My mind was racing. I looked about me, but there was no other soul in the room to bear witness. </Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>My options seemed limited. At that moment, all that presented itself to me was the opened door across the room, at the far end of a slight trail through the chaos. </Passage>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>The window was far too high, after all.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AL" visible={false}>I checked the watch. Still ten past ten.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I rose, and started to dress my-self.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>My clothes lay about me for the most part, strewn spectacularly. A linen shirt was spread-eagled ‘neath one of the broken chairs and two empty bottles. One sock I found swaddled in ‘mongst the sheets at my feet, the other mysteriously be missing. I eventually discovered the battered sags of un-familiar trouser-legs hurled over the dresser and pulled them on in a spirit of improvisation. I picked up the pen that I had initially discarded and slipped it into my pocket, in the view that it might come in handy in some un-foreseeable way. Elsewhere in the carnage I found a sleek phone with a cracked screen, a brown leather wallet and a crumpled pack of ‘grettes, and pocketed all three.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Finders keepers, so they say.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>One shoe was plied into a soggy bag of ice, crushed and slushy, the other beached on a skirting board, its tongue lolling out, eyelets rolling. I pulled ‘em both on – one foot sock-snug, the other bare, sole to sole …</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I laced them up carefully, slipping the aglets into their little loops, and tied it off into a bow, and then picked my way across the floor, careful not to disturb a single thing in this spectacular array, careful to leave every-thing as it had been found, and slip daintily back out the hole where I came in …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>One foot in front of the other, easy enough …</Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>When I reached the door, I looked back upon the carnage one last time, and then passed out into the dark.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Pad, pad, I went softly now, pussy-footing through a twilit hall. Low tables loomed towards me from the gloom, making attempts at my modesty. My vision was blurred, and I was finding it hard to make my way in the gloom. There was a battered pair of spectacles sitting on the floor on one side of the door, and I picked ‘em up to try on, but they only made things worse, so I ‘scarded ‘em once again.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I hadn't realised the extent of my own personal damages until I'd arisen, but I found now that I could barely walk for the belting in my head. Buried ‘neath my temples, something evil was pulling on my eye-strings. There was a thumb of pain passing to and fro, up between my ears, down to my forehead, back and forth. </Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I urgently required lobotomy, I felt, as a matter of necessity. Unattended-to, this hang-over could split my skull …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I tasted the tart residue of last night on the in-side of my cheeks … Like the scent of food that's just started to turn … I felt it in the vacuum in-side my brain socket, sucking on the back of my retinas.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>A stiff swallow of spit, back down the hole where it came in. I needed to wash the stink off my teeth..</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>Twitching cob-webs in the corners contended the breeze with reams and reams of toilet-paper, strung end-to-end over the antique bannisters, along the stairs and furniture. The whole corridor was decked with ersatz bunting as if in anticipation of some celebratory parade …</Passage>
<Passage id="AL" visible={false}>Scuffed rugs with wine-dark blood-stains. A teddy-bear arm, amputated close to the shoulder.</Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>The walls and floor were covered by bubble-gum stamps and the bannisters carried a sleeve of tissue and an up-turned bottle cap bearing a single red-blushed stub amongst its own tiny heap of ash.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="JL" visible={false}>Twitching cob-webs in the corners…</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>Another door, ajar, into what might have once been a study. I glimpsed a jolted spittoon, and a massacre of ripped-up book-covers and empty shelves ... Such violence. Such un-diluted horror. Broken frames and panes on the floor. Another mantle-piece and in the ornate fire-place below it hundreds of torn pages were heaped into the grate. Maybe thousands. Clearly, there had been some desperate attempt trying to abolish literature.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Next up, on the left, a room with one upturned table and a naked bed-stead frame. A ping-pong net ripped loose of its moorings, taking chunks of wood-surface with it. No bats or balls. Inscrutable … And, Christ, so many hats. Homburgs, suncones and trilbies, flat-caps and Stetsons bedecking the whole floor so that I could scarcely see the boards ‘neath ‘em … </Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Where might they have come from? … Who knew? … I carried on up the hall, head humming in confusion …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>A bath-room to the right with a filthy toilet covered in acrid smears and a bath-tub half-filled with bushels and branches of terrorised foliage. Dozens of flowers of all description, uprooted and stacked in some eccentric bouquet. </Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>On the other side of the hall there was another set of stairs leading down to some foul pit.I held up the hair, one end still wrapped tight ‘round my knuckle, and watched it twitching in the rest-less air.</Passage>
<Passage id="AF" visible={false}>The air pointed down, and so I continued upwind, along the corridor.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AK" visible={false}>In a nook off the main drag, a desecrated piano had been left to pick up its teeth. I knelt down to inspect the carnage. The propped lid un-veiled a string-twist mess of mated chords.</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>Who could have done such a thing, I thought, and why? This kind of psychotic rage should not be tolerated …</Passage>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>There was a single, un-recognisable thumb-print on one of the ebonies on the feet. I couldn't even tell whether it was mine or not.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>This was no idle burglary – of this much I was certain ... </Passage>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>The kitchen at the end of the hall was untouched, save for the raided wine-holster, and one knife missing from its rack. Television, laptops, microwave were still in their rightful places, albeit with various pieces of sports equipment thrust through their screens and windows.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I'd have to answer for this mayhem, my fault or not – at which point I could only plead mercy. Offer my sincerest apologetics and copious community service …</Passage>
<Passage id="AB" visible={false}>I could make it better, I felt – I could try. I could set this mess straight … Or, alternatively … Just finish the job ... Burst a pipe or use those pages for kindling ... No, absurd. But abject flight was an extremely tempting alternative. Why not? ... Cut and run. Sweep the prints, get clean away and keep moving.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}>At the further-most bend of the hall-way I found the front door.</Passage>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>A massive thing, all dead mahogany and pig-iron. A small inset of stained-glass in the wood was missing a pane, but still threw low sunlight in prismatic smears ‘cross the walls and dappled pools on the floor and filled the whole atrium with a rippled, aqueous pattern. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="JL" visible={false}>At the further-most bend of the hall-way I find the front door.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AJ" visible={false}> There was a worn, brown dust-jacket draped over a coat-stand beside the latch, the only article remaining besides a worn grey umbrella still hanging by its hook. I picked up the coat and pulled it on without hesitating.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
 <Passage id="AC" visible={false}>I tried the mighty brass handle.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
 <Passage id="AC" visible={false}>It didn't budge.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>Trapped …</Passage>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>This was desperate. I had to get away. At any minute law enforcement could be bearing down on this place like poetic justice. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>I thought a moment.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" visible={false}>A key, a key.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="AC" adds={["BC", "BD", "BE", "BF", "BG", "BH", "BI", "BJ", "BK"]} subtracts="AB" visible={false}>Where'd I seen a key, now?</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="JL" visible={false}>The door.</Passage>
<Passage id="JL" visible={false}>Escape. Flee. Run far and fast.</Passage>
<Passage id="JL" visible={false}>…</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="KL" visible={false}>One foot in front of the other, easy enough …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>The key was cold in my palm, it slid into its nook, and the lock turned with an emphatic click.</Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>And then, heaving the great portcullis ajar, I stepped through into the wider world.</Passage>
<Passage id="JL" visible={false}>The key is cold in my palm, it slots softly, and the lock turns with an emphatic click.</Passage>
<Passage id="KL" visible={false}>Free, at last.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="KL" visible={false}>But I do not move, I cannot. Never could, never would. Not in a month of Sundays.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>What awaited me out-side was nothing short of astonishing. When I heaved open the front door to unveil the wider world on the other side a dead-simple street of unfettered houses like a great canvas thrown up in my path, calm and orderly. This was the full desert of reality …</Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>I stood for a moment on the stoop, simply staring. I tilted my head back and forth, and then, bringing a hand to my mouth, I inhaled deeply through the clenched palm …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>There was a taste lingering in the fresh, new air. The morning was cold and clear, but I still sensed a faint trace, a wake on the surface of this outer space.</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>The heavy scent of tedded grass and petrichor. And a tang, a bite at the roof of the mouth. I would have been a fool to miss it. The memory that a ‘grette leaves behind, wiping its boots as it leaves. I let my tongue touch itself ... Had I been smoking? How very unlike me, I thought … For all I knew.</Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>Ravelling the hair ‘round my finger, I stepped down onto a gravel path next to the thin lawn encircling the de-flowered earth ‘round the threshold. From the outside, the manse in which I had awoken displayed an inoffensive aspect – a polite dialogue of brick and tile with no discernible trace of the devastation within.</Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>I turned to walk down a pavement lined with the cracked tarmac-map of invisible roots buried ‘neath the stone. It was unmistakeable, the accelerated bite. The dry tongue was getting drier. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>I stepped past lattice-steel fences and blank, vacant windows. Black plastic bins with their lids propped along roads labouring under an atmosphere of palpable hostility. The manses had to be passed one by one, too paranoid to huddle close together, keeping their distance and glaring out at the world from behind lacy curtains. All was silent. Schtum. No sense interrogating these inanimate witnesses, I felt …</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Real people seemed very few and far between. Seemed like the kind of mist-spray bus-stop morning on which every-body pretends to be ill ... Up the road, I could see a lone jogger puffing along in a red sweatshirt and steamy glasses, trying to pretend he wasn't perishing before my very eyes. Somewhere elsewhere, I heard the slap-bang of car doors. An ambulance with twirling sirens howled suddenly out of a side-lane and all along the street the manses watched it go, windows suddenly alight with reflected interest …</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>This bespectacled jogger was the first person I had seen, and I must admit that I felt a certain excitable curiosity. As he approached, I tried to offer him a smile, but he seemed to refuse my attempt at friend-ship, keeping his eyes firmly fixed in front of him, jaw clenched tight as if from some localised rictus …</Passage>
</p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>What city was I even in? Something told me it began with a C. C—-  Cr——?  It was far from the tip of my tongue. For all I knew, it could be the surface of the moon. I couldn't dare ask for fear of arousing suspicion, and these blank generic houses offered few clues. Whatever city it was, it had a river - but don't they all?- which I did glimpse momentarily through a roadside thicket, and  which this path seems to follow, vaguely, up towards some central font. </Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>,Surely most people knew these things instinctively, or had friends to remind them. How bad had last night been? </Passage>
  </p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>I resolved to try again as I spotted a woman in the near distance hustling along the pavement. She was wearing a clinical face-mask, with a bouquet cradled in her arms. I had some time to plan things properly as she approached, and as we came to pass, I exclaimed with a well-timed coo and enquired whether they might be for a sweet-heart, but she too only averted her eyes and even increased her gait ‘til she was past. Highly suspicious behaviour, I thought, but there you are …</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Why the mask? And why such disgust? Was I such a stranger? …</Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>All this was deeply confusing. I thought it must have been Sunday. It is frequently Sunday, after all …</Passage>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>Yes, it should be Sunday.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CJ" visible={false}>Soon I felt the first streak of rain sprinkle my cheek. It could only have been early morn, but ‘neath these clouds street-lights were already beginning to prick them-selves into action ‘gainst this mock dusk. It couldn't have been late, and but already it was getting dark.</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Finally, I found the faintest smudge of ash on the corner of a curb at a wide T-junction. Glistening lines of cars were groaning past in thicker numbers the closer I plunged into the city grid and the air was becoming dense with exhaust fumes and numbed by the advancing rain, so in all this commotion it was gradually becoming harder and harder to pick up that same feral tang. I looked across both legs of the cross-roads, and then down the other pavement-branch. I walked on a distance, my head low, my eyes on the cracks and the dusty rims of phone-poles and street-lights …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>I found another grace of ash on the lid of an old post-box. The street had seemed to have been rinsed clean over-night and only the wrecks of ancient phone-booths and gum-stamps marred the path up-town. Spots of ash were as clear as a clear day on the ground before me. Yes … that slab there, that railing, that spot on the window-sill of a funeral parlour. On a STOP sign, there and there ... </Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Ginger-bread crumbs, to guide me further into the woods …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Now what fresh failure...? A stubbed char, a scorched-black O on the red chest of a NO CROSSING man, and a spent nub lying on the ground below …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Curses. Foiled again. </Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>This was a spectacular stymie …</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>Well ... No matter, I thought …</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>The filter bore a kiss-blushed blood-rose blossom on its nether-tip.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>I had to pause for thought here, for it seemed I had reached a dead end. But something within me told me that this was no way to end things … It ix the sensibility of the addict to always crave more, natch. No moderation, no measure of sense, no proportionality or logic to that need. I hopped through the shuffling lanes of traffic to reach the far side of the street, and searched the ground. …</Passage>
<Passage id="CF" visible={false}>There – another grey spot dropped from a fresh light. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CD" visible={false}>Hope rises from the ashes.</Passage>
<Passage id="D" adds={["DD", "DE", "DF", "DG", "DH", "DI", "DJ", "DK"]} subtracts={["CC", "AD", "BD"]} visible={false}>Hope rises from the ashes.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>I felt the rain growing in gusto now, spattering down onto my head and shoulders.</Passage>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>I kept sniffing out those dark ash-spots at my feet like a truffle-pig in mulch – a smudge on a dust-bin, a low lump on a wall ... On and on – but more and more often I was finding the ash dashed away by rain-drops or dissolving where it lay, and knew that I was on a fuse – that, in no time, there'd be no trail left to follow … I vaguely regretted not picking up that umbrella when I'd had the chance … But no matter.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>Just as it was really starting to come down, I spotted a mark on the bar of a push-door leading off the street into an adjacent stack of red brick and cement. No sign in either direction, I followed my gut and pushed the door ajar to enter a rust-coloured stair-well that smelled of piss and saw-dust. A climb up to the first grated landing granted me a reward – another perfect, tiny oh of ash. A single syllable of matter …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>At the top of several flights I reached a door that was ALARMED, or so the sign on the inner latch exclaimed. No escape from the roof, I thought. Trapped like a bat in the attic …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>I pushed it open.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>But no. No-one …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>The roof was bare, save for the antlered forks of antennae and a small, battered deck-chair with orange and green stripes, rain-spotted and rusty. Nothing to be seen there but an urban view-scape across a mutinous tangle of extension cords and humming ducts, empty as my own grave … And, to top it all off, a final smudge on the floor, and a red-blushed butt stuck upright on the scuppered balustrade which ran ‘round the roof-top tarmac. </Passage>

<Passage id="CC" visible={false}>I stood on the edge of that drop and looked down at the humming lines of traffic and the people on the street below, as they ran for cover under the advancing nimbuses. I looked up to the spires and the ‘scrapers and to the pinnacles in the distance, and up into the remote chime of church bells beyond, like the un-mistakeable sound of a city giving up.</Passage>

<Passage id="DF" visible={false}>I discovered a tree-less park in a square behind a few blocks of semi-elegant buildings in which I resolved to take shelter before the storm could fully descend. It was relatively secluded and free of good citizens. Plenty of benches. Good for sitting, I thought …</Passage>

<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>As the rain really started to come down, I sat and turned out my pockets, inventing my inventory as all manner of bits and bobs fell out onto the bench beside me …</Passage>
<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>There was the phone, natch. It occurred to me that it must hold some numbers, some crucial information to aid me in this search, and so I inspected it closely The crack running across the screen was long and ugly, but the damage seemed superficial. I tapped it on, and the screen lit itself instantaneously. But this was only a heart-less trick.</Passage>

<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>The pack of cigarettes was a little the worse for wear after a ride in my lining. I prised its battered lid open and found six butts nestled in-side. Two were snapped at the base with their innards coating the foil in a fine powder. I chucked them away. One of the others was standing with its open end pointed up, upside-down in the packet … There was no mistaking that this was the Lucky One, a smoker's token of worth. Invaluable in the right sitches – though I had no lighter with which to make this dream a reality. </Passage>
<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>The wallet that I'd found in one of the trouser pockets had no cards, no ID or library memberships, no real credentials what-so-ever … Only some motley notes and coins. A cache of cash. How ironic. Twelve and five, or something similar. Abstract worth. Meal tickets and potential bribes …</Passage>
<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>And, let me see … Pocket fluff. Chits and chads. Nail-clippings and nose-dust and bits of ‘bacco. I still had the pen of course, but no paper to write on, natch.

<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>I felt something else hard at the bottom of one of the jacket's deep saddle-bags, and when I thrust my hand in-side to explore, it came up holding a small, lightly-bruised fruit. Some runted species of lobster-apple, probably – or was this a peach? … Who knew. It was small enough that I could hold it in in a palm and close my fingers over the top to meet at their tips. I sniffed the skin and tried polishing it on a damp sleeve. In the end, beset with doubt, I squirrelled it away in the pocket from whence it came.</Passage>

<Passage id="DJ" visible={false}>Some-thing was missing, I thought, some-one. I couldn't be precisely sure what or who, but I keenly felt the draw of some further piece missing from this whole. It was the presence of absence, real to me as these two feet.</Passage>

<Passage id="DE" visible={false}>I was in dire need of a warm drink, and a change of clothes and a bath – some things never change.

<Passage id="DE" visible={false}>What had happened to me? … I needed witnesses. Raw data, known facts – urgently, or before I knew it I would be over-run by suppositions.

<Passage id="DF" visible={false}>An unopened soda can was trundling along next to a fire hydrant, minding its own business, when a coupe pulled up to the curb. As the can fell under its front tire, it detonated with a gun-like report, sending the pooch into a minor hysteria of yipping. The driver stepped out and lay a hand on her head to calm the bitch, and then looked up at the sky and scurried towards the nearest shelter as fast as possible. The rest of the citizens were all throwing forward their hoods and flipping their coat-tails, looking every which way but up, while every bundled object seemed bleeding with motion and energy, as if each one held its life in thaw.</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>After a considerable while, I happened to notice that the window out of which I'd been directing these sentiments was flanked on either side by a pair of large, candy-striped poles that were alternately twirling to the reveal the words BARBERS and PEPPY. Once I turned to see the interior, I saw that this was indeed the case – a couple of overly-presentable blokes were mincing ‘round in front of long mirrors, snipping a steady snow-fall of hair from the heads of two obliging men in bibs and those same surgical masks.</Passage>

<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>Her lips quivered as if at some inner tension, but she seemed kind, and full of that open, un-assuming trust which seemed to invite my own – and so I could not help but acquiesce …</Passage>

<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>What could I do? … I had no need for a hair-cut, just shelter. But I had no choice but to take the throne.

<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>Christ knew what she wanted all this information for – tax returns possibly. I had no choice but to throw her for a loop like that, making up outrageous facts about my life and circumstances to stymie her inquisition.

<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>Just wished I'd had the confidence to just scarper once she'd finished.

</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>She extended out a hand to me without further word, and I eyed it in trepidation. My greatest challenge yet – and, yet … I felt a strange, contrary urge for physical contact of any form. Un-crossing my arms, I threw caution to the wind and seized her, shaking the proffered hand a tad wildly, I must admit. I then dropped it with some force and leaned back triumphantly, trying to brazen it out as though I had just bested her with some new and better technique. She laughed, and said she needed compensation – and after another awkward pause, I realised I had no choice but to pony up the dough. After I'd drained my pockets, she returned my gaze with a new garnish of respect that perhaps hadn't been there before. I could see that she understood … If only we could share a single point of reference.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="DD" visible={false}>While she'd been performing her dread task, my eagle-eyes had picked out a news-paper clipping that was pinned to the mirror. It was a feature ‘neath the picture of a blonde-curl lil' cherub in a tiara advertising some show put on by a neighbourhood arts studio. This gave me pause for thought. Once I was freed from my restraints, I asked my Grooms-Woman whether she could identify something for me, and unwound the hair I had kept ravelled ‘round my forefinger for her to examine. She shrugged, suddenly off-put and reticent after her attempt at deposition, but after I pressed the issue of the clipping she mentioned that she cut the dancers' hair at the uptown studio from time to time, and that yes, some of ‘em were dark – just like this one …</Passage>

<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>I managed to present my-self at the community studio at some point later that day. I should hardly have found it had I not stumbled across a likely-looking sign and dived inside to escape the maddening rain.

<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>As I ventured into through the atrium into the first corridor, I saw that the studio was a tad dilapidated and dis-used, the floors dirty linoleum and the ceiling bulbs all bare and flickering. </Passage>
<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>Every un-varnished door along the corridor had a small window set into it, but when I looked in, most of the studios were either empty or happened to be packed to capacity by some geriatric dance class with a couple of youthful coaches conducting a cohort of elderly ladies with arms like pterodactyl wings.</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>After some time wandering the halls and staring in at the various rooms, I found my-self at the door of what seemed to be the largest studio, where a lil' class of ballerinas in black tutus were rehearsing together. They were all lined up on a rail ‘neath the hyper-critical eye of a terrific Instructress, one hand keeping ‘em steady as they practised their pliés. Tinker-bells and twinkle-toes. I watched for a while through the door as the whip-hand barked and bludgeoned the lil' girls into better form, but saw limited improvement. They were all practising gestures of the same swan-neck wrist-and-elbow swoop … Hand up, cradling the neck and flung away. A shoo, a coax … Keeping their eyes upon their own posture in the mirror, in time with tinny cassette music whining out of the corner. Such poise, I thought.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>After the class had ‘spersed, I took the whip-hand aside for a rinse. The Instructress looked like a fate worse than death. Looked like a bird had shit in her coffee that morning …</Passage>
<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>No time for my questions, natch. Yes, they had had a dancer here who matched that description. No, no-body had seen anything of her for several days. She couldn't say how long exactly. I said I under-stood, but I wasn't sure that this was completely true. When I asked the girl's name, the Instructress seemed off-put. </Passage>
<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>She asked if I didn't know her name already, and when I replied that I obviously didn't, she got extremely shirty and started asking what my angle was. I told her that I didn't mean to be obtuse and was only checking in on some-one for whom I was worried, and had natch come where I knew she was most likely to be. </Passage>
<Passage id="EE" visible={false}>She asked if I was making an allegation. I replied that I was not, by nature, an alligator.</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>Down, most definitely. Into the Deeps I go.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>The time was getting tight, this much I knew. All of the proper beds for the night had no doubt been snapped up by more sensible citizens hours ago, or even years. Daunted and downcast, I presented my credentials – that is, my-self – at several realistic choices, bed-sits throughout the Deeps with grimy signs and epileptic interior lighting. I desperately needed retreat, a sanctuary from this grim exterior reality – but though I had little ambition as far as quality could go, I was inevitably turned away at the door of each establishment I tried before I could even ask the price. Nothing to lose, nothing to fear, natch … </Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>This abject excuse in mind, I soon washed up on the urban scree, shaking my-self off at a wooden patio table ‘neath a tarpaulin lean-to at one of the dirtiest, mustiest cluster of buildings in the Deeps' very core, and staring up at a sign over-head bearing worn words, one of which I was sure was HOSTEL, above what looked to be PERMANENT VACANCY.</Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>A splintery patio table bore a small huddle of denizens who regarded me warily, most smoking as they did so. This seemed just the sanctuary I needed. A runway for run-aways.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>Before long, a grim-faced proprietor answered my frantic knocking, and once I was admitted into the dank hallway that doubled as an admittance office, we could talk business. I might say that I took a fairly heavy hand, as I was determined at once to hammer this thing out and be done with it. He laboured the whole deal with such an irritating level of pleasantry and negotiatory pussy-footing that before long I was itching to fetch him a hiding for sheer cheek. I couldn't afford to chuck my meagre coins on such fripperies. There was no telling when more funds might present them-selves, and I could hardly count on largesse.</Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>The last I saw of the rotter, he was scuttling off to some back-room repository with his tail ‘tween his legs, muttering some-thing about sheets, and I didn't bother waiting for his to return …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>It seemed that I had scored a single bunk in a small, cold room that I was sharing with the denizens. I found one of these– a tattooed bloke in a mask and wrinkled shirt – perched on the bottom rung of three bunks when I came in, poised with his hands on knees as if a single motion might shatter him like blown glass. He gave me a minimal nod as I entered, which I returned without improvisation. I didn't lament the loss of privacy so much, elated enough by the sensation of being in-doors. Besides, I s'pose I counted my-self in their denizen ranks now, God love ‘em … </Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>There was also one wash-room adjoined by a door at the foot of my bunk, currently closed. When I looked up, I saw that the bare ceiling was lined with pipes and eerily textured by curdled paint-drips which had solidified like flows of melted wax. There was just one spare shelf, on the top. </Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>I stripped off my sodden dust-jacket and laid it on the bunk so as to claim it territorially, and laid atop. Peace at last.</Passage>

<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>After a while, I reached into my trouser pocket, extracted the pen and dangled it arrow-straight above my eye so that I could check the sights …</Passage>

<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>I held it first in one hand, then the other, testing ‘em both. Was I right- or left-handed? Or possibly ambidextrous? … I was sure that this one mattered. But which was right, any-how?</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>It was when I was stripping down in the temporary dignity of the shared washroom that I saw the state of my-self, for the first time, properly, in the grimy sink-side mirror, the skin which had lain hidden ‘neath my garms now totally exposed …</Passage>
<Passage id="FG" visible={false}>Ribs and arches pushed them-selves at the chafed skin like tent-poles. Scratches and claw-marks. Furious wheals in my flesh. I looked like a failed mutineer.</Passage>
<Passage id="FG" visible={false}>I stuck out my tongue and inspected it – a slick, slack moistened flap …</Passage>
<Passage id="FG" visible={false}>I tried a smile, but it ended up just looking like some sort of weird grimace. God knows how these expressions were supposed to look, but I wish some-one would've taught me how.</Passage>

</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="FG" visible={false}>My skin was eroding away in sloughs from the damp, but as I was assessing the damage I caught sight of some more markings on my side. Not slashes or bite-marks like all the rest, not indents or muscle-creases. These were the faint, but still visible, marks of ink, faded like last week's henna …</Passage>
<Passage id="FG" visible={false}>This was not some night-club stamp or cattle-brand – these were decisive pen-strokes …</Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>Cursive words down my belly, all the way to the groin …</Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>What was this then, some love-letter, some kiss-off good-bye-note? … Or some obscure invitation or a crucial instruction which I had over-looked? … The one word I could tell for sure, scrawled somewhere in the middle of the third line, was FUCK … </Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>But I could just make out the rose-stamp of a mouth, lip-stick in pink ink after the final scribbled-cruciform signature – X X  … Marking my organs for harvest, perhaps.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>I washed up in the sink, dragging a hard bar of soap over the worn lines of grime in my skin, scrubbing out the pen-stains and, after the briefest hesitations, the kiss-print below it. I ran my hair under the tap once to clean it, then pulled on my undies and lay my other effects out to dry, displayed as fully as I could manage along the sides of the room. </Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>My face looked at the mirror again. My hand went and flipped off the light …</Passage>
<Passage id="FJ" visible={false}>I exited the wash-room, snatched the sheets from the un-occupied bottom bunk and crawled back up to my sarcophagus, eyes closed to the loathsome shifts and grunts coming from the others. </Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>When I checked the phones' contact, there'd been only a single name-less number saved inside. Far-be-it for me to ring at random, I gave it a go. It had rung and rung, but at pick-up it blared with such cacophony I could made no-thing out, only able to shout characteristic phrases down the line to little effect – but it was a clue none-the-less, I thought.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Even at this late hour, which-ever it was, the street out-side of the hostel was ram-packed with people, smoking and shouting and generally spreading ruckus, a blurred and bobbing crowd of loud faces descending in an ants-trail line towards the source of some sick, arrhythmic bass-thump echoing out from the downtown streets under the Deeps like the beat of some hideous heart …</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>This seemed a safe bet.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>This was the sonic epicentre. The axis of this great, cracked web. Deep in the Deeps. Here the buildings loomed so far over-head on both sides that it was like treading the bottom of some abyssal oceanic trench, my own body the sole protection against the crushing pressure all around. The walls either side were so tall as to induce a kind of vertigo, blocking even the faint, polluted light in the clouded night-sky so that I had to listen my way towards the music, navigating the dark between each glowing street-lit pool and through the un-seen icy puddles at my feet, following the crowd I could sense both in front and behind.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The entrance to the club was just a hole in the pavement down Garton Street, stairs down into a noisy lair. The size of the crowd huddled out-side told me it that was a big night, but only by sight, natch, as the chop and slash of music from below was making communication difficult already. The queue was monstrous, and of course I had little money to speak of, but the swarthy bouncer out front let me in when I told him I'd left my wallet in-side and made a big fuss about my admittance stamp washing off in the rain. I was regarded with some suspicion, but clearly not as any realistic threat. I'd left my dust-jacket back at the hostel to air out properly, and though I was wet, cold and probably looked a little rough ‘round the edges, sweet pity was perhaps flowing in my favour, and so after a terrific out-cry from the head of the queue, and thankful but un-apologetic noises from yours truly, I was finally let loose through the doors.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Yes, no mistaking where I was, now. This could only be the inner-most cave …</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Once past the ranks of grim-faced security-men and coat-check troglodytes, I made my way down through a series of red-lit ante-chambers of increasingly close air and deafening volume. Chintz cushions, iron lamps and those in-escapable hookahs decorated the dark on all sides. Booths and couches propping up stiff, hunched forms. Tweakers straddling a brittle knife-edge, a high-strung wire … The looks on some of those faces told me that they were strapped to an anchor. Fifty-thousand fathoms and still falling. And they knew it, that was the terrifying part …</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>A shirt-less man with several huge, beaded neck-laces was sitting on the floor, crushing pills with a pestle and wrapping them in receipt-paper, with his back to a dread-locked girl who was massaging his back in an intense, obsessive sort of way. He offered me something as I passed, but the gesture was lost amidst the noise of voices. In the next doorway, a black man whose clothing seemed made from hundreds of dangling strings was pouring shisha smoke from his nostrils. I felt the eyes behind the shades following me as I stepped carefully over the dark forms at his feet – possibly pillows, possibly not. My shoes were sticking to the floor in some places as I walked, sliding through puddles elsewhere. The air was dizzyingly hot now, after the cold of the street, and when I put my hand to the wall to steady my-self, my fingers came away glistening, with a rust-sweet smell from the sweat running off the concrete. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>As I plunged further through these tunnels, the visible walls were becoming increasingly grimy and covered in graffiti. The dark was deafening now, and I had to make my way towards the source by following the shuddering row of fluorescent bars in the floor.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I turned a corner into a long, quiet tunnel, also adorned with liberal graffiti, but otherwise empty and utterly dark. There was a bright light culminating the vast distance to my left, however, and as I turned to face it, it began growing in intensity, brighter and brighter and roaring along to the music – ‘til at the last minute I threw my-self back into another tunnel across the rails, allowing the train to thunder past less than a palm's-breadth away, all dark windows and sparking tracks.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I made my out-side to the smoking-area, back out the hole where I came in – up, instead of down, and out again into a sulphurous cage. The area was roofed by a wide geodesic dome in neon slats like a huge, luminous climbing-frame, the lights shifting in sections like a mesh-net of oscillating colours. The resultant effect gave me the impression of being in-side the belly of a jelly-fish, but it was still a welcome relief after the intensity that still reigned in-doors …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I recognised her immediately, the moment I entered. Or thought I did. The instant thrill of recognition that draw you to a person without quite placing it.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The girl on the far side of the area. Her dark hair tied back from her face, bound in some wild form, neon-green within the lime-light, above a sharp face of painted lashes, a calligraphic brow, glistering hieroglyphic tattoos etched skin-dark up her left shoulder.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The dance was slowly ebbing from her, and her thin, bare legs were struggling just to stand, but she was neck-deep in some grim altercation. A slap-head with ear-rings and no shirt had her by the wrist, trying to yank her towards the floor.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>But there was no doubt about it. Some-how, some-where, we had coincided.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I drew the hair from the watch, but there was no comparing under this neon. I saw at once that this sitch required some protracted interrogation. Time to get to the bottom of this horrid affair, once and for all. With any luck, she might recognise me back.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>But before I could fully close in, I saw she had spotted me and without hesitation was wrenching her-self loose and striding voer, face ablaze.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>–There you are! – What kind of hour d'you call this, then?</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The rotter, for his part, looked at me like come-down incarnate.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>   –The fuck's this?</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>–We're involved.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>That was all he needed to hear, apparently, and bid us adieu. She watched him go, teeth tighteneing, and once we were alone she let her shoulders sag, her knees bent and palms tucked under her bare arms, shivering slightly. It was cold enough out there to turn every breath out of her mouth to coal-smoke, and she wasn't wearing much more than bangles and bead neck-laces. Up close, I took a long look. Rings and long, sharp nails. A tight black top on top of some fish-scale material. Black shorts and red kicks at the end of long, bare legs.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Her dark hair was oily and its top-knot was straggling loose of its scrunchie, and the black tattoos up her shoulder were shining with sweat. Her bottom lip looked raw and gnawed.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>And now that she was up close, I could see the penny-wide dilation of her pupils, and the tightness of her jaw-line as she scanned the crowd around us. </Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I gave her a smoke from out my battered pack and she screwed it into the corner of her tight mouth. I toom one my-self. Neither of us had a light, but we scrobbed one off of a skinny, semi-tranquilised tweaker who acted as though he ‘spected it back … He shook his head when the Girl asked whether he had any water going, and told us the whole place was flowing.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The Girl asked whether I had water, and then when I said I didn't, she asked for gum. When I said no again, she went hard and silent as though considering desperate measures, and sucked furiously on her stub, moving her knee in a restive twitch. </Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" adds="Ii1" visible={false}>I looked about me absently, then turned to her all at once and spontaneously came out with the first question that came to mind – </Passage>

<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>A mad-woman, clearly. I saw the desperation in her eyes, that she had self-destructed long ago and was only performing that kind of low, soft dance that flames make with air. I saw straight through, natch. Smitten, the poor thing.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>But some-thing in the lines of the girl's face told me that this was one thread worth pulling on. It was everything, really – the shape of her eyes, our proximity, every one of these collected circumstances … The features were too complete, too familiar, and packed in such outrageous density that nothing there-in could be blamed on sheer observance. She was a dead ringer, and the whole thing stank of kismet. Sweated it – and not just the harm-less breed of pimpish luck. Destiny-destiny, natch … The Big Bitch.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>After I'd fetched some water from a bar in the ante-tunnels and sat her down somewhere safe in the mausoleum, she seemed to calm down, gulping down the entire bottle ‘til it imploded with a sucked crunch of de-compression, and tossed it ‘neath a bench. I struggled to keep up as she struck off again with commendable purpose – her legs were almost gone, but she seemed possessed, her wide eyes full of that dead-star intensity for the floor. Her course was of another bend entirely, though – up and opposite, so that in no time we were stumbling out into the street and the startling cold and rain again, past the bouncer and through the glare and blare, the katzenjammer of the city street sounding like conch-echoes after the noise below.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The luminous dome in the smoking-area had protected us, but now the rain lashed down on us un-abated. I felt increasingly exposed and the Girl was shivering worse than ever – but still she was striding away fast enough that I could barely keep up, determined though I was.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>As I trailed behind, I looked at the perfect, sharp shape of her shoulders. Crossed arms and clenched. I looked too at the crease-soft back ‘neath her pony-tail. Goose-dimpled legs. The tension showed in her neck while she stabbed the pavement irritably with her sneaker-heel at each stop-light. On her arm, below the tattoo, there were four horizontal lines. Deliberate marks, scab-red.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Where were we wandering? Through streets that could have been recognisable in adequate light. Those same stretches of asphalt and brick that constitute the various interchangeable pieces of suburbia.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>We hung a right, and suddenly I was certain.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Too complete, too perfect …</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The same house, without much doubt. Same stoop, same denuded grass patch and drained windows.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The Girl tried the door with her shoulder at first, but to my surprise, it didn't open. She stepped down from the door-way, looked ‘round for a moment, then stooped and tilted up a flower-pot by its base. A key was nestling under-neath.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>As she thrust it into the lock-slot, she looked back at me and asked what I was standing there for. Those wide, wide eyes. There was a smile tugging at one corner of her battered bottom lip. Tightly pursed, with the tongue playing the crease from the in-side …</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I saw with X-Ray clarity that right then her body was balanced on the tipping-point of a fulcrum. I saw the hormonal dump of serotonin and oxytocin, swelling, squirting glands, marinated in anticipation. All instinct, smitten with danger, horny for apocalypse …</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>My heart was a dance of fear. So, I sensed, was hers.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The door slid open and she disappeared into the inner dark. Moments passed, endlessly. Then a voice came from in-side …</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>She told me to hurry the fuck up.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>The Girl didn't turn the lights on in the hall-way, or on the narrow stairs up to the first-floor landing. </Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>We moved with the same dumb courtesy from door to door. Mine, practised – hers, improvised, both careful not to disturb a thing.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I could tell there must be other people nearby, asleep, somewhere in that manse. I thought I heard the catch of wood-saw snoring even as we stood there. I felt an urge to leave, as soon as possible – but before I could move, the Girl moved again as if in tune with my own thoughts. I didn't say a word, but only turned to follow, making for the stairs. A pronounced creak ‘neath my feet halted me about a third of the way down, and I waited a moment to check that we hadn't raised an alarm, my heart spitting out beats. I still smelled dog. But there was nothing. No-one behind me either … I waited for a second, or perhaps a minute, then crept slowly up to the landing.</Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Framed photos on the wall, weirdly askew. Hand-me-downs and forget-me-nots. Smell of dog. The sly corner of a prayer-mat protruding from a door-way. Another shisha peers down from a pedestal atop a shelf. </Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Sepulchral silence. Afloat in close air, a sensation like opened fruit</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>I was studying a school picture at the top of the stairs when I suddenly sensed far-off motion somewhere in the manse, and my stomach lurched at the thought that we might at last have disturbed some slumbering entity in one of the other rooms. Then I realised that, without my noticing, the Girl had slipped me again, and was now two or three rooms ahead. It was her making this slight commotion – this sound of sliding covers … Hushed haste. The suspended tension, and the bra-clasp release. And, like that, it snapped.</Passage>
</p>,

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Orange light was spilling into the nursery-room in slats from the street-lamps out-side. The Girl was on her knees beside a tiny crib, arms crossed on the rail over an un-covered form, still sleeping …</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>No-thing else here but the bassinet and a chest of drawers with diapers and wipes spilling out. Stars on the mobile, and walls slopped clumsily with yellow paint. A hasty job. The window across from me was open a crack, and a cold draught was tickling the threads of her hanging hair. Beads of water still clung to them, to her thick lashes, ink streaming across her face. </Passage>
<Passage id="IJ" visible={false}>Two wide, black holes, looking down at that face with a soul-selling ferocity. Only now, the child was in her arms. There was a bag at her feet, and the drawers were open …</Passage>

<p>
<Passage id="IK" visible={false}>There was only one sensible reaction at this moment ¬– and luckily I was in the rare presence of mind to see it. Back away, very, very calmly. Make your way, softly, slowly, to the door. Don't disturb a single thing. Don't upset this precious balance. The only hope of survival to make it to the door and down the road, to follow the fresh taste of ashes, back down into a city which was already bellowing its beckons.</Passage>

<Passage id="KL" visible={false}>I still had a couple of ‘grettes, the pen and that damned watch. By force of habit, I checked the time. No change.</Passage>
<Passage id="KL" visible={false}>I fished the apple from my stiff dust-jacket pocket where it was lying fossilised across the radiator and considered it anew. I was ravenous – but simply couldn't bring my-self to scarf some-thing so utterly foul, so stashed it away again. After all, there was no knowing how desperate things might get.</Passage>
<Passage id="KL" visible={false}>I opened the phone. I had to try, natch – but there were no messages stored in there, nor any reply to my calls.

  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="LN" visible={false}>It's that time of the night when people are mostly on their back in various terms of surrender. To that point in most parties where the bunting is usually ripped and the balloons are all frowning from exhaustion. When boredom is starting to lay a terrible hand on the tiller. When we're none of us going to be talked to in tones like that anymore. That we're deciding that we're not going to be put upon so crudely any longer.</Passage>
  <Passage id="LN" visible={false}>The energetics of the party have torn the house apart as a kind of gross physical salute to the needs of youth, halted only by the final exhaustion of booze and destructive potential. </Passage>

  <Passage id="LN" visible={false}>We would live like ghosts, walking a new life across the city, ‘til the shoes wear out and we're obliged to chuck ‘em in and find a fresher pair. You could fish out a name and photo on-line, catch a new set of numbers in the net and then shop for an address and a new life-story. We have these negative eyes for the urban sprawl, seeking out the blind-spots – no-places which could fall silent and empty at night … Wipe-clean lobbies, waiting-rooms, office-zones. Places where no-one stays for long. Scalping for hot tickets, we'd patrol each street in the Deeps, looking for the fullest mail-slots, the longest grass, lights off and trash-less. We make our nests on such bare branches. Climb inside, bar every-thing with broken furniture and jam spare keys into all the interior locks so they won't turn. </Passage>

<Passage id="LN" visible={false}>I feel you before you announce your presence, sitting with me, alone in the silver lining. I taste the tang of strict metal, and the scent of your coconut tobacco.

  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>At that moment, the dreadful proprietor shoved his face through the door and started making a racket about the bed. This fresh hell might have pranged me, but I couldn't let the imposition of having to catch this brick interrupt the nice tide of momentum which had started to build in my favour during the final acts of the previous night. Worse things happen at sea, so they say, and stranger.</Passage>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>Nothing for it but to stick my oar in again. I re-dressed, cleaned my teeth with the hem of my shirt and pushed off from the hostel, not bothering to check out before hitting the street again with new feet, carrying all my worldly possessions my back. I couldn't even say what my next move would be. Where would take me in for another night, with lucre running this low? … I was so poor I can't even afford friends, but if I couldn't find someone or some-where recognisable in these Deeps soon, I'd be doomed. No sense retracing my steps any further, of returning to the scene. I was parted from my partners – and from any recognisable certainty. And the possibility of complete physical and mental collapse was suddenly very real. The stakes were stratospheric, and I could ill-afford further delay. It was still raining, natch, still cloud-gloomed and dark as evening out-side. Impossible to say what time of day it was if any. But this was no time for conjecture, I thought … You can think at aimless length and never get one thing properly done. It was time for swift and decisive action, this I knew with absolute certainty. Misery loves company, so they say …</Passage>

  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>The police had probably cordoned off the house in question with rolls of forbidding yellow tape by now. They'd be chalking up the bodies and facing down all available witnesses with angle-poise lamps and a snarling Dobermann. Set one foot near that place and they'd smother me with nets, drag me to some tank down-town and pump me ‘til my sanity gave out. Drug-searches up the wazoo. Turn me into a traumatised, gibbering sludge, slide a false confession under my nose and use my hand to sign it. Then off to the pen for a fifty-stretch and an end-less cycle of gang-fucking and yard-time for the rest of the fore-seeable future. Yes … No sense returning ‘til I was iron-clad. A flawless alibi and a team of attorneys of epic proportions.</Passage>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>I knew how to duck and weave in a trial, alright. Leave ‘em tied up in knots. Surprise witnesses, bewildering filibuster and abject objection. Judge the judge, hang the jury. Equivocate, shout Preposterous! at any given opportunity, or just jabber oaths and wild accusations ‘til the entire thing is called off in confusion. In the ensuing madness, file quietly for insanity.</Passage>

  <p>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>I confronted an officer with chapped lip-stick who seemed to be guarding a cash-point on the high street and asked her whether there had been any un-usual call-ins over-night, but she just told me to mind my own bees-wax and to be on my way. I asked her to please keep a civil tongue, and were those what counted for manners in the constabulary? She made no reply to this. Things were getting hairy, I thought, so the only thing for it was to tell her that my brother was in politics, and that he considered habeus corpus to be the corner-stone of life itself.</Passage>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>She didn't deign to reply to this, and so I sidled off, fairly satisfied by this show of resilience. I knew not to try my luck – but a message had to be served. Yeah … Not one to fuck with sarge, a real heavy-hitter … Tough bastard …</Passage>

  <p>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>I was getting into one of the town's densest pedestrian streets, the main shopping drag. The lanes there were choke-full with people out and about, in family groups or coupled squeezes with rain-slicked anoraks or toting umbrellas picking out garms from the store-fronts or pottering ‘round like concussed stoners, ogling it all without real object. Seemed like an extremely high volume of foot-traffic for a rainy Monday morning. Possibly it was still Sunday … Or had yesterday in fact been Saturday? … It strained causality to say for sure …</Passage>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>In any case, this outrageous density is what I meant by getting right into the thick of things. A forest is the best place for fire-wood, natch. Just strike a match and wait for it to climb. Let the rascals pass. Scope the crowd. Stand stock still, and the world will dance for you. Sit any-where, and before long, some bastard opportunity will come begging to impose itself upon you. No initiative required …</Passage>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>The only thing to do is to find the right perch.</Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="MN" visible={false}>Eventually, after much critical inspection, I ‘scovered a seated slot ‘neath a shallow veranda, out of the rain. I was wedged on a ledge between a brick wall and a post-box that was slicked green with the run-off from a drain-pipe, with a commanding view over the pedestrian mall from a mezzanine out-crop. A fine perspective of the passing crowds, and a generous wad of soiled card-board and news-paper ‘neath my feet that showed real promise. It seemed a fine place to post up, to stamp cold feet and wait out this continuous sentry, huddled up in the wrappings of my dust-jacket and peering about me.</Passage>

  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	It is so early it's late, the table piled high with pearly plates. Nice china and fine, thin glasses. Every place has a fresh red napkin which is folded like an origami crown. Perpendicular cutlery and ambient music. Sara is placing snapped candles on the table cloths, propped up in jam-jars.</Passage>
  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	The dining-table is adorned with all the incredible finery which could be fetched from every drawer across the house – shining silver-ware, holly-sprigs, toy soldiers and chess-boards, pyramidal stacks of bottles and resplendent chrome sculptures all atop a clean-swept moire table-cloth.</Passage>

  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>We live here, for now – we, the un-invited diaspora, an invasion force without qualms for collateral damage.</Passage>

  <p>
  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	The bald-headed bloke – I think his name is Penrose – sidles in and calmly slides him-self into the head seat without a qualm. In absence of a host, seating seems fairly arbitrary. Penrose un-furls his napkin and tucks it into his collar like a bib, and takes his knife and fork up and starts banging on the table with their handles, shouting out some improvised call-to-arms.</Passage>
  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	They come down to find him already downing a glass, some-thing thin and clear from a champagne flute. You tell him not to wait on our account and he chuckles and rubs his shaven head, not deigning to reply.</Passage>
  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	I've saved your place, and you lay your hand on mine by way of thanks, taking your seat with grace. Smile, and you catch my eye for a moment and then turn to say some-thing. A muffled cheer comes, difficult to say who from.</Passage>
  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	The bottles are passed around, glasses filled and emptied amidst rude remarks. There is uproarious talk and rude chants, save for the collective pause when-ever the sound of car tires prowls by on the street out-side. You graciously defer to Penrose's pawing affection, shooting me shared glances of bemused aggravation when-ever his flattery becomes too outrageous. At one point, Penrose asks whether he can scrob a smoke, and you say he can, natch, but when I reach for the box I pilfered from one of the drawers in last week's farm-house, it comes up empty. I glance over to where you are sitting across from me, over-borne by the candle-shadow looming up behind you. Your eyes do not leave mine as you pull one of your ‘grettes from the bag at your hip and place it in your mouth, lighting from the candle at the table's centre. </Passage>
  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>	Just then, Penrose says the funniest thing any of us have ever heard. It's all I can to stop my-self from falling off the chair, it's so un-believably hilarious. I wait for you to smile – but the painting does not move, and the room dims and ripples around me in that pause. And then you pull that irresistible face, and sigh, and say that you love him too.</Passage>

  <Passage id="NP" visible={false}>I think I should be angry, on reflection. I think I should tear down the wall-paper and batter the piano to bits with a chair-leg. Rip up the rug and dis-mantle the furniture, tear apart the books and smash the pictures. I think that I should scream around the house in a vague rage, looking for some-thing living to kill. Yes – put the chairs on their backs, legs in the air, burn notes in the bin and panic. Stagger back, tearing this hole wider. Rip the flowers up and strip the beds. any-thing to tear loose some antidote, some desperate cure. I will gut the teddies and smash every bottle I can find. I will find one forgotten hair on the floor and wrap it ‘round the dial of my watch as some pathetic keep-sake. I will break. I will fall to the floor, sobbing and tearing at my clothes, flinging them all over the place. Douse the whole place with a fire extinguisher and tumble back-wards into a slew of bed-clothes.

  <Passage id="OP" visible={false}>I found my way next into the wilderness of vacant lots behind the Deeps. Chain-link fences cordoned off sections of cinder-blocks covered in graffiti like screams of spray-paint, in-decipherable names and rotten calligraphics written for the sake of writing. The only legible word seemed again to be FUCK, over and over on every vertical surface. A weird set of swings stood in the middle of it all, next to a slide with a wary denizen perched at the top like some ‘splaced savannah baboon, surveying his territory …</Passage>

Human fluids and all the caked shit of a wind-shield in bug-country … Christ. And every now and then, some-thing really surprising. A single, detached steering wheel. A dead goat with a plastic bag over its head. A marigold glove like an eerie dis-embodied hand, clutched about a broke syringe. Bullet-shells, trigger-trash. Empties. An ol' piece of sandwich in a pool of some-thing dark. Crutch, crutches, bottle-caps, a ski, the Complete Works … An electric shingle of discarded disks, shimmering like fish-scale. A leery rubber duck, land-locked … Who made all these treasures? … Who fashioned all the lamp-posts and wrote each street-sign? … Some un-remembered dreamer, lost to history.</Passage>
  <Passage id="OP" visible={false}>Look, look, a dirty band-aid, plastered stickily on the curb. Look, ripped wrappers and a huge pack of ice-cubes full of street-grit and ‘grette-butts. Chair-legs and corks and detachable umbrella-handles. Shoeless shoe-laces and an abandoned, battle-weary flag so grimy that it was impossible to tell what the original colours might've been … Degenerate excess. One man's trash, so they say.

  <Passage id="OP" visible={false}>Over the rain came a sudden, faint hissing sound and, as I turned, a low dark shape emerged from the curtain of drizzle behind me, scuttling ‘cross the ground. It was a loose tire. It scythed through the gutter puddles, carried by sheer momentum, mounted the pavement and met the chain-link fence at the edge of the lot with a fatalistic crash. It teetered on its rim un-certainly for a moment, then collapsed onto its side, exhausted.

Skullers thudded their way back up-stream as the dark fell, ‘til the few that were left were detectable only by the passing of their bow-lights and the bitch of their riggers at the catch.

Through a low path of dark holly, over a cow-sty and through a puddle that soaked my numb feet colder – and then I was through, onto a street of dim-lit cottages.

  <Passage id="OQ" visible={false}>A motor-bike and rider zoomed on the village lane by like some doppled monster, pipes howling from raw exhaustion. I passed a faded cenotaph covered in faded war-names, fallen to obscurity, plastic poppies rimming its base like ulcers. </Passage>

  <Passage id="QR" visible={false}>They would tolerate me for a while, and then once I had settled down they would carry me back to my room and tuck me back in.

I was surprised to find that every flower-bed had been re-planted, and when I tried the door, it was actually locked … Clearly, no-one was home, however – the windows were dark, and the drive-way empty, so I circled ‘round to the back-yard through a small side-gate to case the joint …</Passage>
  <Passage id="OR" visible={false}>Let me see … Small lawn, no real watering-cans or plant-pots to speak of. Clean, green grass. A low patio wall with no loose bricks.

They don't know the depths of their own shallow-ness – ‘cause ignorance is a gift you can never enjoy. The rotters just don't see that the whole world is only this – people walking door to door, running their luck, saying their peace. Yes – it's all a word game, a truth game.

I paced about the place, experimentally running my hands over every-thing, even pausing to sniff at couch seats and to inspect the mantle-piece. The little brass crocodile I'd noticed before grinned up at me, as if to say welcome back … And only now, I could look at the pictures on the mantle, back in all their original frames.

  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="TV" visible={false}>Dew from last night is shining upon the clean, green grass. I pick my way carefully around the piled bottles and trash-cans on our door-step. The street is peaceful. A lone swallow is singing on the garden post, and it takes flight as a lorry rumbles past on the street, streaking suddenly into the air. A calico cat pokes her smug face out of a privet hedge, regards me naughtily, and then slinks back into the bushes, out of sight and out of reality.</Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="TV" visible={false}>I sit on the edge of the lawn, facing the open door, waiting and listening to the toneless beep of reversing-lights-lights down the street, out-side the King's Head. I wait there for a long time. A cloud the shape of an umbrella or an elongated toad-stool hangs over-head. Church bells awaken across the street, sounding one more slow, dong-less ding to mourn the air.</Passage>
  <Passage id="TV" visible={false}>It must be Sunday, again.</Passage>
  <Passage id="TV" visible={false}>I watch the old home for signs of movement. One of our front windows is out of its frame. Blue smoke is eking out the chimney like the oil-fire of some stricken whaler. The sun is behind me, and the face of the house-front is aglow in the early light. I bring up a cigarette from my pocket and light it, inhaling deeply, and the morning air attains the sharp taste of nicotine. Now you are coming out of the front hall-way and slamming the door behind you with some force. In-side, there is the tiny, tinkling sound of some-thing breaking off and falling to the mat. Then peace returns.</Passage>
<Passage id="TV" visible={false}>We do not bother locking up. I throw the key into the bushes. </Passage>
  <Passage id="TV" visible={false}>Our shadows are on the door. You are lighting another smoke, holding the lighter very close to your face. No bags on our backs, we walk, hand-in-hand, talking to our-selves down the short path to the village street, beside the flower-beds. Amongst blue-bells, hyacinth, physalis and nustirtium and clytemnaestra, I pick a snow-drop and suspend it in your hair. Your fingers go to it absently, still holding the cigarette. We stand at the gate-post, looking both ways down the street.</Passage>

  <Passage id="ST" visible={false}>I tore another out, then another and another, ‘til I had a small mound of crushed paper in front of me. I took one more page, walked across the kitchen and held it over the stove, twisting the knob ‘til it clicked and caught, sending the page up in a curtain of flame. I dangled it before me, watching the words turn to smoke, reading its signals. Then I took it to my pile and set it amongst the others. They went up quickly. Then so did the table-cloth and the table, and then the drapes, the chairs and tables and portraits.</Passage>

  <Passage id="ST" visible={false}>Out on the back-yard stoop, I locked the door behind me, and went to sit on the low garden-wall out back to watch it go up. I stayed there for a while, just long enough to make sure. Once I saw flames licking from the upper stories, I rose. Carefully returning the key to its hiding-place ‘neath the sand-castle pot, I made my way carefully ‘round the side of the house again, just as the upper-windows began to splinter from the heat and the crackling emissions burst out to join the air – the squeal of souls boiling, all trapped and on fire.</Passage>

I start to gag, staggering back from you – I look at you fully in the face, but now your features are shifting, black tarantula-eyes melting into mouth, nose and ears trading places, un-recognisable. My world turns, the hands spin. My mouth is full of hair and my teeth are shattering. Doubled over, I am spewing out long, braided coils, ravelling down to the floor and still you look to me and you burst bellowing into flames – not just red but yellow and purple-blue and eerie green – and up comes that rushing noise, the cacophonous ice-cream bells and church peals in High B, dog barks and the turn of the years, tide on tide – and your voice, deep and low and beckoning, filling me with dreams and pulling me on-wards, thrilled with fear –</Passage>

  <p>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>I didn't linger long to listen, this time …</Passage>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>Getting onto the platform was a simple task for one of my talent – the morning rush was so intense that at ten they just opened up the barriers in-side the station-hall and let the whole mess spill through rather than have them wait while tickets get checked, and so I slipped through like professional espionage and, from there darting on board the first train heading up-valley was a slice. The conductor by the doors didn't even bat an eye, let alone raise any kind of alarm. He was wearing a pair of dark glasses, and I thought perhaps he might be blind and working purely off the sound of the engines and the beep of the mechanical doors …</Passage>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>Any-how, on-board there was just a single security attendant, a fantastically over-weight, jolly-jolly sort of rascal who spent most of his time chatting and chuckling with the other passengers rather than mounting any sort of trouble-some investigation. As the doors hissed shut automatically, and the lurch of motion informed me that we were pulling away from the platform, I spotted him coming from afar, moving steadily down the packed aisle with his chad-clippers, checking the tickets of every-one on board. He had his work cut out for him, natch.</Passage>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>Clearly this dupe took phenomenal pride in his work, so when he got to my row and asked me whether he'd checked my card already, hadn't he? … I simply didn't have the heart to crush his professional pride – so I said he had, natch, and he apologised profusely after that and continued down the car, negotiating the floor of the rocking carriage as though it were glazed with ice …</Passage>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>The bloke sat in the seat next to me sounded as though he were dying of lurgy. At first, I'd been worried that he might give my whole game away during this confrontation, call Bull-shit! and have me thrown off the train. He was clearly a model citizen, and I therefore presented a real danger to every value he held near and dear – but he was too pre-occupied honking and blowing snot into his elbows to be worrying about any-body except him-self. The only contribution he made during my exchange with the inspector was a loud Ex-squeeze me! after having finished a good long bout of hacking. But I didn't have the heart to refuse him, or to abandon his company for a more salubrious position by my-self. By the sound of things, he might've been in need of an organ transplant any minute. And so I sat percolating as the train rumbled off along its route and gazed about me, while the city-scape whisked by out-side.</Passage>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>When the train pulled up at last to its final stop, I gathered my sparse effects and exited forth-with. I'd ridden this steed as far as the tracks could carry me, as far from the city as was possible, and now it was time to make new arrangements. I'd find new berths, new ‘stractions and, Big Bitch permitting, a fresh start. Yes, this was to be a new chapter of boundless possibility. Now, I could see, all the tides were starting to turn in my favour …</Passage>

  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>Stood at my elbow was the same conductor with the dark glasses who'd seen me off, still stood there hooting away again on his little whistle and ushering new passengers aboard from the very same platform from which I'd departed earlier that day. I waved a hand before his face in confusion, but if he recognised me he didn't show it. This was stupefying. Over-head, the tannoy was booming out –</Passage>
  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>-	PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE, THEY ONLY GET MORE THE SAME, AND IF THEY DO, IT'S ONLY FOR THE WORSE.

SO, SO, I TOLD JASON THAT IF HE WASN'T WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE TILDA THEN I'D BE MORE THAN WILLING TO PUT HER UP, BUT IN THAT CASE, THAT MEANS I'M GONNA JUST HAVE TO MOVE OUT, BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T DEAL WITH SOMEONE THAT SELFISH, I MEAN HOW HE COULD EXPECT …</Passage>

  <Passage id="UV" visible={false}>Every-thing was utterly un-changed, un-fazed. The rain came down on me still, tapping on my shoulders and mouthing a chilly whisper. I felt the certainty rising within me like a dark wave as I rushed back out the pedestrian gates to the street out-side. There was no doubt in my mind – it was the same station. The same street beyond. The same humming buses, same righteous flow of oblivious citizens, same gutter-deep city, same endless rain. I stood on the pavement, giddy with dis-belief. At that moment, I felt a strong pull up-wards, a strange pressure at the base of my skull. I no longer felt the ground ‘neath me, nor the rain on my skin.

  <Passage id="XY" visible={false}>We would rush down to the sand under the wharf to poke and peck and peer down at the huddled packs of barnacles and whelks in the tide pools. We would poke the anemones into startled retreat, pulling back their rubber-glove fingers, knocking on the shells of crayfish who click their snippers in consternation and scuttle off. We would play with kelp fronds, draping them in slimy wigs across our grinning faces like monsters'-hair. Playing, playing, in the warm pools, until the tide came rushing back in at a thousand miles an hour to send us scarpering back up to safety, quick as the pipers pecking at the shells between waves.I remember the sea-shore breeze toying the little curls out from your Alice-band as you stand at the light-house rails, feeding the gulls.

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>	Same time, same place. Hardy a change worth accounting for.</Passage>
  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>Still the rain. It blotted out streets and buildings, and turned passers-by into mist-ghosts in the static, as evanescent as coding glitches. After un-countable days the drains had become over-fed, wretching up in swells. Puddles knee-deep, un-fathomable. Must be careful not to be swept away by the rising tide. The rain was setting about erasing all the memories of the day. The words had been washed clear off of the signs, and now they stood like blank grey slates at intervals up along each and every road. The rain wiped the paint down the walls and into the drain, so that now every store and manse were transfigured into raw stone, name-less and identical. The leaky street-light bulbs all filled up like goldfish-bowls and extinguished. It filled my shoes and my pockets, and had long-since washed the writing clean from my chest and stomach … Surely this couldn't be fair, I thought. Surely no rain-fall could continue in-definitely … Or maybe so. Clearly, the odds were stacked against me upstairs, I thought. I could not escape the idea that I was gradually being dissolved like a tooth dropped in cola, gradually being dis-integrated and washed away down the gutters and pavement cracks, staining the ground with the remnants of my tread wherever I walked …</Passage>
  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>The folks on the pavements now were not so much ‘zens as drift-wood, dead jetsam or stranded bloats. My own desperation kept painting their faces with recognisable features. In the distance, they all looked familiar – ‘til being resolved into strangers up close and passing by, newly anonymous and staring into their palms. No-one stopped or slowed in their walk, lingering to talk or to look into the store-windows. The stakes were too high to pause ‘neath this down-pour.</Passage>

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>For days on end after that, I stayed and slept in-side an old bus-stop on Drummer Street. It had a covered slat-bench in a kind of perspex cage that was closed to the elements on three sides and above, and so I was able to take up residence on a more-or-less permanent basis. I had only a single coin remaining in my wallet, and so to me this seemed a reasonable fall-back option to proper accommodation. The only hiccup was that buses ran ‘til late in the evening, and, ‘til then I had to tolerate sharing the shelter with the a constantly shifting crowd of citizens. This was a gamble, for there was always the chance that they might react to my presence with a spontaneous lynch-mob, or simply turn me over the vague malicious forces of what-ever Conspiracy it was that I could sense in my pursuit. </Passage>

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>There is no doubt in my mind. A bus has stalled, two-abreast nestled up close to another across the broad street, and through their side-windows I can see a long fall just visible ‘neath the grey hem of a worn umbrella on the pavement beyond. Shimmered through four layers of reflection, rain-smears dropping, drops dripping, passing by on the far pavement and then beyond the edge of the window and cut off from my aisle of view –</Passage>

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>The bus is starting to pull away from the stop, but I am darting ankle-deep across the river of the street-surface, slipping a little as my shoe-print skids beneath my tread.

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>I could tell that I had to get off the street and out of this vacuum of alienation and despair, but I was at that paralyzing degree of self-awareness where you catch your breath and then become un-able to shake the grasp of inhalation and exhalation, un-able to stop thinking ‘bout it for fear lest it stop, ‘til your very consciousness seems in-extricable from the sound of each breath rolling through your ears. The thought of thought, like clapping hands … But even automatic matters become laborious chores the more that you interrupt yourself – that precarious balance of foot-on-foot-fall, the act of speech becoming the impossible emission of some obscurely-mannered sequence of sound – all feeding self into self ‘til you are frozen into place, like a snake fixated on its own tail, biting itself into knots, un-able to move. You start thinking, and you forget to walk. You look down, the tight rope loosens, the loose rope tightens …</Passage>
  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>The reality of my predicament was becoming lost within wreaths and reams of abstract conjecture … Nothing to do then but to force events to their natural conclusion, letting the run of justice take its proper course. Let the pendulum swing. I was at the final bend, turning for home. This third act shall fill the story full. This should be orchestrated with grace, letting every perfect circle fall in its place, every link in this chain present and correct. I anticipate the fulfilment of perfect sense. Events start as they mean to proceed, with reason and purpose – and so there's no sense panicking, no need to run or search. The Big Bitch has it all in hand … I was to arrive at the end when it came, and what it was, or when, I'd no cause to question.</Passage>
  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>This was meant to be – for it was I who meant it. I knew what my destination should be – and, looking back now, I was absolutely right …</Passage>

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>Once safely back below the surface of the Deeps, I found my-self leaning up against a corrugated drain opposite the fence of a ball court and lighting up my final cigarette – the Lucky One, no less – with the matches I'd found in the church, which were already soggy from the coagulating dampness in my coat-pocket. I needed it now more than ever, for I was now on a losing streak of truly ‘sturbing proportions …</Passage>
  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>My ankles were caked with mud from the walk from the station, my feet wet and freezing. The rain wouldn't let up – and worse than all of it together, I was no closer to dispelling the cloud of noise in my skull. I crumpled the cigarette box up in my fist and knocked it against my thigh while I fought for thought. A low guitar noise was coming from some-where ‘round the corner, strangely tuned …</Passage>

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>Brain pounding. Un-bearable pressure. A desperate need for sleep. Rest and peace … But nowhere would have me. I had the in-finite, in-definite dark space in front of me to pick my place of rest, and no-where else. </Passage>

  <Passage id="WX" visible={false}>I was in a split mind over my future course of action. Money didn't worry me – not as it should have done, certainly.

  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>It seems as if I have to reinvent my-self every day, for lack of any-one else there to remind me who I am. I rise from bed, no longer sure if I am the same person who lay down to rest. I tend to go by what I find about me. Whose clothes are these on the floor? ... Whose sheets are these? Who owns this home and dropped this phone and left this door un-locked? ... Me, natch. But fuck if I know why.</Passage>

  <p>
  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>Back on the streets, it was time for full-throttle scrobbing. Time to boil the buds and scrape the plate. Aim-less and shameless, I spent as much time as I could openly begging in the puddles along the mall and I used the coppers this fetched to eke a living, scran or shelter each day. Finally a life-style I could get on board with – none of the fripperies of modern existence. Strip away the ‘stracting trash, and what are you left with? … The real world – I'd found it, at last.</Passage>
  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>I'm sorry to say that not long after that came a period during which I descended into degenerate attitudes. I'd leech as far as possible off of other denizens I met in the hostels and parks – booze, smokes, any-thing going, natch.. … I stole lemons from a grocer's outdoor display and ate them ‘round the corner, gobbling ‘em up greedily and I discarded their empty rinds. Every now and then I'd pass a fresh-smelling skip in the allies, and I'd have to investigate. Once, I found a third-full tin of dog-scran, and took incredible relish polishing it right down to its rancid bottom, licking the last edible slop from the crannies in search of gross, sensual excess. I found a lockless bike leaning against a row of park railing and rode ‘round on it for a while, calling names and shouting out to the people I saw ‘til the chain slipped and I abandoned it, forlorn, in the flat-puddle nowhere of an empty parking-lot.</Passage>
  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>Every-thing and every-one else seemed to have moved in from the rain. It was just me and the lowest tier of denizen, out in this pitiless void. These were real, pavement ‘zens, gutter-folk, the real no-hopers. I split my shoes with the walking, both soles flapping off in their step and leaving my old socks wet and filthy, as knackered as my-self. I tried selling my long-dead phone to the owner of some knocky-shop on a side street, but even the foulest specimen of that bottom-feeding species of pawn-broker wouldn't have it. Apparently a cracked screen hurts the resale-value … As for clothes, I kept taking on layers wherever I found them. Plastic-wrap and news-paper. Scarf-parts and tattered blanket rags. They were all piled up on me ‘til I could hardly move my arms, and I'd waddle about like some absurd goggle-doll, some weird goblin, festered and filthy. It kept the damp out though, despite the sight, and the heat in. Now good citizenry would swallow their jewellery when they caught sight of me.</Passage>
  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>My lone apple had long-since withered up like a huge, soggy walnut, but I did eventually find a taker for it too.

  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>At some point, I collapsed in an alley-way that was covered in orange vomit-stains and took shelter ‘neath the lower-landing of a fire-escape.

I couldn't even bring my-self to weep – couldn't even bring my-self to feel a thing, beyond a vast and private privation, detached from the sense of real feeling or connection to my surroundings.

Just as I was about to return to my rest, the voice started out again, un-mistakeably near. From in-side the skip.</Passage>
  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>I peered in-side, and in amongst all the variety of other trash was lying a crippled shop mannequin, head twisted back-wards on its torso, limbless save one stiff arm pointed up-wards out the hole, in a kind of sad, valedictory salute. </Passage>

  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>My watch still showed the same time, natch. Ten-ten. Almost as if no interval had passed at all since I'd first picked it up from the floor.

  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>I touched the pen's cap, and immediately a gush of pent ink spilled out from in-side onto my fingers, drops spattering down to spend them-selves on the steps below – but then, amazingly, some of the drops hovered there in the air before my very nose, frozen in place like commas of floating smoke, in-dependent from gravity.

  <Passage id="YZ1" visible={false}>I gripped the lid and twisted it loose. Carefully holding the pen near the nib, I traced the word    bed     in the air in front of me. The letters appeared, darkly, etched ‘gainst the light coming through from behind. It seemed as real as my own hand … And the pen in that hand felt as snug as any-thing. I brought my other hand close to the floating letters, brushing my finger-tips along their cursive lines … It felt warm, the word. Softer than a sunset.

  <Passage id="Z11Z12" adds="Z12Z13" subtracts={["Z10Z12", "Z11Z12"]} visible={false}>You close the page, and the lay the book down upon the mess of bed-clothes at your feet, amongst the toppled copies of its friends. You catch sight of the picture on the front cover, and smile. </Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="Z11Z13" visible={false}>You check the time on an old watch lying amongst the detritus, and then rise and start collecting clothes, assembling your-self from the scattered pieces. One flat-top, wedged ‘neath a displaced door-mat. The other you have to tip free of a load of cigarette-cartons. Check your face in the cracked mirror hanging on the wall. Pick a bag, and pick it up.</Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="Z11Z13" visible={false}>You will pull on your clothes and make your way across the ruined room to the door. You will ooze out into the hall, over the teeth of the trashed piano, still tasting the evening's bite on your bottom lip. Chasing the taste of your last lover, back out the hole where you came in.</Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="Z11Z13" visible={false}>Open the front door, stand on the stoop and gaze up for a moment into the gathering sky. Maybe it looks like rain. You might take the umbrella from the hat-stand and put it under your arm. Grope in the mulch at the bottom of your bag, and carefully draw up an un-broken cigarette and lighter. You light the tip, inhale, and then go.</Passage>
  <Passage id="Z11Z13" visible={false}>I will remain here, nestled in the sheets splayed on the floor, left amongst the other refuse, the left-overs of some un-known tryst, not knowing where or what I am. </Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="Z11Z13" visible={false}>I do not know that this is so, but I can dream. For I cannot see, in the dark, only feel. I cannot follow, and so I shall remain.</Passage>

  <Passage id="Z13" visible={false}>The sphings are feeding. A grand-mother is playing with a little girl in a knitted hat, telling her a story as they go. They are picking up fallen apples from the lawn. Big apples, huge and bruised. Cooking apples. Big as two fists.</Passage>
  <Passage id="Z13" visible={false}>When they're gone, we can start to cut the grass again so it looks neat. Washing is drying on a line near-by.</Passage>
  <Passage id="Z13" visible={false}>The swallows are playing in darting wheels over-head, engaged in some aerial waltz with a yellow kite which is tied to one of the gate-posts.</Passage>
  <Passage id="Z13" visible={false}>Washing is drying on a line nearby. Beyond, there is a stone cottage with open windows, and the sound of a running tap is coming from in-side. And beyond that, the mountain-top vista all the way down to the valley floor, over gardens of blue roses and lily-pond with Oriental bridges.</Passage>
  <Passage id="Z13" visible={false}>Now and again, the swallows dart down to drink from a bird-bath beside the summer-house. I am sitting on a chair just under the arch, next to a flower-bed of hyacinths and roses. I have set down my paint-pot and I am drinking water from a high-ball glass.</Passage>
  </p>,

  <p>
  <Passage id="Z13" visible={false}>As I set it down on the path, the grand-mother and the little girl start to make their way down towards the house. The old woman opens the wooden gate and the girl lugs their wicker basket through, as heavy as her-self, giggling with glee.</Passage>
